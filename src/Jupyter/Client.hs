This module provides an easy API for writing Jupyter clients. Jupyter clients (also commonly called 
frontends) are programs which
communicate with Jupyter kernels, possibly starting them and then sending them requests over the
ZeroMQ-based messaging protocol. Examples of Jupyter clients include the Jupyter console, the
<http://jupyter.org/qtconsole/stable/ QtConsole>, and the <Notebook http://jupyter.org/>.

Communication with clients is done in the 'Client' monad, which is a thin wrapper over 'IO' which 
maintains a small bit of required state to identify a running kernel and the sockets on which to 
communicate with it. The initial state and connection information is supplied when you use 'runClient',
which requires connection information and the 'Client' action to run.

The 'runClient' function also requires a set of 'ClientHandlers', which are callbacks that get called
when the kernel sends any sort of message to the client ('KernelRequest's, 'KernelOutput's, and 'Comm's).

These functions can be used quite succinctly to communicate with external clients. For example, the
following code connects to an installed Python kernel (the @ipykernel@ package must be installed):

@
import Control.Monad.IO.Class (MonadIO(liftIO))
import System.Process (spawnProcess)

import "Jupyter.Client"
import "Jupyter.Messages"

main :: IO ()
main = 
  'runClient' Nothing Nothing handlers $ \profile -> do
    -- The `profile` provided is a generated 'KernelProfile'
    -- that the client will connect to. Start an IPython kernel
    -- that listens on that profile.
    liftIO $ do
      'writeProfile' profile "profile.json"
      'System.Process.spawnProcess' "python" ["-m", "ipykernel", "-f", "profile.json"]

    -- Find out info about the kernel by sending it a kernel info request.
    connection <- 'connectKernel'
    reply <- 'sendClientRequest' connection 'KernelInfoRequest'
    liftIO $ print reply

handlers :: ClientHandlers
handlers = ClientHandlers {
    -- Do nothing on comm messages
    'commHandler' = 'defaultClientCommHandler',

    -- Return a fake stdin string if asked for stdin
    'kernelRequestHandler' = \_ req ->
        case req of
          'InputRequest'{} -> return $ 'InputReply' "Fake Stdin",

    -- Do nothing on kernel outputs
    'kernelOutputHandler' = \_ _ -> return ()
  }
@

--
-- This function sets up ZeroMQ sockets on which it can connect to a kernel; if no 'KernelProfile'
-- is provided, it generates a fresh 'KernelProfile' which contains information about the ports and
-- transport protocols which it expects the kernel to connect with. It guarantees that the ports it
-- chooses are open â€“ that is, that no kernel is currently connected to those ports.
--
-- The generated 'KernelProfile' is passed to the user-provided @'KernelProfile' -> 'Client' a@
-- callback, which may use functions such as 'sendClientRequest' to communicate with the kernel. If
-- the kernel sends messages to the client, they are handled with the callbacks provided in the
-- 'ClientHandlers' record.
--
-- Most clients follow a simple pattern:
--
-- 1. Invoke 'runClient', passing 'Nothing' for the 'KernelProfile'. This allows 'runClient'
-- to set up and choose its own ports.
-- 2. Write the connection file containing the chosen ports to a JSON file using 'writeProfile'.
-- Make sure to write it to a temporary directory, to avoid clobbering user directories with
-- connection files.
-- 3. If you do not know the command used to invoke the target kernel, use 'findKernel' to
-- find the 'Kernelspec' for the kernel you wish to launch. Then, use the 'kernelspecCommand'
-- field to generate the kernel command invocation.
-- 4. Launch the kernel using 'spawnProcess' or a similar function, providing the connection
-- file you wrote out as a command-line parameter.
-- 5. Wait for the kernel to connect to the client using 'connectKernel'.
-- 6. Use the output 'KernelConnection' from 'connectClient' to communicate with the kernel
-- using 'sendClientRequest' (and maybe 'sendClientComm').
